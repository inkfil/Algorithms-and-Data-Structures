## mathemathical representation of complexity.
1. Upper Bound runtime complexity of an algorithm (Big-Oh notation)
2. Strict Upper Bound runtime complexity of an algorithm (Little-Oh notation)
3. Average Bound runtime complexity of an algorithm (theta notation)
4. Strict Lower Bound runtime complexity of an algorithm (Little-Omega notation)
5. Lower Bound runtime complexity of an algorithm (Big-Omega notation)

## general complexities.
1. constant time cmplexity

# Datastructures

### String Datastructure
```
linear/
homogenous/heterogenous data elements

```

### Array Datastructure
```
Array (Static sized array)
Vector (Dynamic sized array)

arrays are sometimes refered to as lists
elements stored in contiguous memory cells
homogenous data elements
linear datastructure
can be indexed
once created, cannot be resized and must be coppied to new (bigger sized) array, element wise in order to insert new elements

operation that can be performed on arrays:
insert
delete
traverse
search
```

### Linked List Datastructure
```
Single Linked List (forward traversing)
Double Linked List (didirectional traversing)
Circular Linked List
```

### Queue Datastructure
```
Priority Queue
Dequeue
```

### Stack Datastructure
```

```

### Tree Datastructure
```
Binary Search Tree
AVL Tree / Hight Balanced Binary Tree
Ternary Search Tree / n-ary Search Tree
Breadth First Tree
Depth first Tree
Spanning Tree
Minimum / Maximum Spanning  Tree
Red Black Tree
Splay Tree
Radix Tree (Trie)
Suffix Tree
Huffman Tree
B- Tree
B+ Tree
Binary Tree
R Tree
Counted B Tree
K-D Tree
Decission Tree
Markel Tree
Fenwick Tree
Range Tree
ab tree
Quad Tree
```

### Graph Datastructure
```
Adjacency Matrix
Incidence Matrix
Adjacency List
```

### Map Datastructure
```
aka HashTable, HashMap, Dictionaries, Lookup Tables, Assosiative Arrays.
Map (ordered)
MultiMap (unordered)
```

### Set Datastructure
