# Genetic Algorithms.

they are a type of ```Evolutionary Algorthms```.
they are ```adaptive heuristic search algorithms```.

i.e. these algorithms are adaptive to change in environment.

they are based on ```Genetice and Natural Selection```

they are used to generate high quality solutions to optimization problems. (i.e. to find the global optimal problems).


terminology.
optimization
search space
global optimum
local optimum
global maximum/minimum
local maximum/minimum
population (group of individual)
individual (possible solution to a given problem)


operators of Genetic Algorithms
selection
encoding
crossover
mutation



Gentic Algorithm Flow:
1. Start
2. initial poplation
3. coverage
4. if coverage is YES, then STOP
5.
