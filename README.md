# Algorithms and Data Structures

## mathemathical representation of complexity.
1. Upper Bound runtime complexity of an algorithm (Big-Oh notation)
2. Strict Upper Bound runtime complexity of an algorithm (Little-Oh notation)
3. Average Bound runtime complexity of an algorithm (theta notation)
4. Strict Lower Bound runtime complexity of an algorithm (Little-Omega notation)
5. Lower Bound runtime complexity of an algorithm (Big-Omega notation)

## general complexities.
1. constant time cmplexity
2. Linear time complexity
3. Logarithmic time complexity
4. Quadratic time complexity
5. Exponential time complexity
